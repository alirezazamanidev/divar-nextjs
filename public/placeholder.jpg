This is a placeholder for an image file.

To use real images in the project:
1. Add JPG, PNG, or WebP files to the public directory
2. Name them appropriately (e.g., placeholder.jpg)
3. Reference them in your code as "/placeholder.jpg"

For development purposes, you could:
- Use external placeholder services like https://placeholder.com
- Create simple colored boxes with CSS
- Use data URIs for small simple images
